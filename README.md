In this Project 0 according to the given description i have followed all the instructions given for creating 4 HTML pages along with HTML TAGS and CSS Properties.

I have extracted the Index.html folder into local repo folder.

Now by using Hyperlink refrence "href" and Relation propertie rel i have pasted the hyperlinks of another pages.

So in Index.html page we have all the pages hyperlink so we can re direct to any page by using those links.

I have created list of pages like
1. Personal_Blog.html
2. Warfare_project.html
3. Editing_Tech.html
4. Msit_Memes.html

And i have used ID, .class, selector, @media, Bootstrap grid models, SCSS properties i.e. Nested,inhertance.

Also included Next and Back buttons to redirect to anypage from being at same page.

Using the CSS properties i have mdified my page with colours, alignment, fonts, table alignment e.t.c.
SCSS is sub part of CSS propertie by using SASS tool we can generate the CSS file from SCSS file.
As HTML page doesn't agrees with another extensions so we need to include .css files in order to make changes in the Pages.

Bootstrap is a default resizer of our page where our page will resized depening upon the devices and its interfaces. It includes defaluth fonts and alignments of the text so that our page will look much attractive than before by using the bootstrap.
Finally by using GIT i have generated the link for my HTML pages.
